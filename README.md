# NAND2TETRIS
### Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Using NAND logic gate)


### Hardware Layer 

  -  [X] To build Elementary Gate using Hardware Descriptor Language (specific to Nand2Tetris) The implementation of fundamental Nand Gate is provided
    
  -  [X]  To build Computational Gate or (Combinational Gates) Full-adder, half-adder, Incrementer and Arithmatic Logic Unit (16-bit ALU)
    
  -  [X]  To build Sequential Gates, Counter, Register, RAM, ROM The implementation of D-Flip Flop is given
    
  -  [X]  Designing Assembly Language for the Hack Platform
    
  -  [X]  Build the Hack computer platform, which will be the top most layer of Hardware Architecture
    
  -  [X]  To convert Assembly Language to hardware understandable sequence of bits (1 or 0)
  

### Software Layer

  -  [X]  Assembler 
  
  -  [X]  Virtual Machine I, convert static arithmatic and memory access instruction in VM language to assembly language.
  
  -  [ ] Virtual Machine II, conver flow control and function calls in VM language to assembly language. 
  
  -  [ ] Jack language syntax and symantics
  
  -  [ ] Compiler I, to break the source file into tokens and produce an XML with code constructs.
  
  -  [ ] Compiler II, from the tokens write the vm code for the source file
  
  -  [ ]  OS
