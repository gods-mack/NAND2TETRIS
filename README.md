# NAND2TETRIS
### Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Using NAND logic gate)


Hardware Layer 

  -  To build Elementary Gate using Hardware Descriptor Language (specific to Nand2Tetris) The implementation of fundamental Nand Gate is provided
    
  -  To build Computational Gate or (Combinational Gates) Full-adder, half-adder, Incrementer and Arithmatic Logic Unit (16-bit ALU)
    
  -  To build Sequential Gates, Counter, Register, RAM, ROM The implementation of D-Flip Flop is given
    
  -  Designing Assembly Language for the Hack Platform
    
  -  Build the Hack computer platform, which will be the top most layer of Hardware Architecture
    
  -  To convert Assembly Language to hardware understandable sequence of bits (1 or 0)
  

Software Layer

    - Assembler 
    - Virtual Machine I, convert static arithmatic and memory access instruction in VM language to assembly language.
    - Virtual Machine II, conver flow control and function calls in VM language to assembly language.
    - Jack language syntax and symantics
    - Compiler I, to break the source file into tokens and produce an XML with code constructs.
    - Compiler II, from the tokens write the vm code for the source file
    - In the last 3 changes, we took for granted the OS, in chapter 12 we build the os using jack language. OS, consists of array, string, sys, 
      output, memory handlers (to be implemented)
