# NAND2TETRIS
### Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Using NAND logic gate)


Hardware Layer

  -  To build Elementary Gate using Hardware Descriptor Language (specific to Nand2Tetris) The implementation of fundamental Nand Gate is provided
    
  -  To build Computational Gate or (Combinational Gates) Full-adder, half-adder, Incrementer and Arithmatic Logic Unit
    
  -  To build Sequential Gates, Counter, Register, RAM, ROM The implementation of D-Flip Flop is given
    
  -  Designing Assembly Language for the Hack Platform
    
  -  Build the Hack computer platform, which will be the top most layer of Hardware Architecture
    
  -  To convert Assembly Language to hardware understandable sequence of bits (1 or 0)
